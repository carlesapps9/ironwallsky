# Implementation Plan: Iron Wall Sky — Sky Defense Core

**Branch**: `001-sky-defense-core` | **Date**: 2026-02-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-sky-defense-core/spec.md`

**Amendment 2026-03-07**: Engagement & monetization improvements added (enemy variety,
combo multiplier, daily streak, remote config, two new rewarded ad placements, share card).
Full amendment plan with data model delta, constitution re-check, and new events:
→ [specs/main/plan.md](../main/plan.md)

## Summary

A minimal, portrait-first mobile defense game where enemies fall from the sky
and the player slides horizontally to position under them while a weapon auto-
fires straight up. Built with Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Vite, packaged for
Android/iOS via Capacitor, deployed as a static PWA. Ads-first monetization at
natural breaks only. Deterministic core logic separated from Phaser rendering
via adapter pattern. Offline-first with service worker. Short 45–120 s runs
optimized for organic sharing and rapid retry.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (strict mode)
**Primary Dependencies**: Phaser 3 (2D engine), Capacitor (native shell), Vite (bundler)
**Storage**: localStorage / IndexedDB (device-local high scores and config)
**Testing**: Vitest (unit, deterministic core), Playwright (optional E2E smoke + offline)
**Target Platform**: Web (PWA), Android (Google Play via Capacitor), iOS (App Store via Capacitor)
**Project Type**: Mobile-first PWA game
**Performance Goals**: 60 fps, ≤ 8 ms per-frame CPU, ≤ 2 MB heap growth/min
**Constraints**: Offline-capable, portrait-first, fully playable muted, fully playable ads-blocked
**Scale/Scope**: Single-screen game, 1 enemy type (v1), max 40 simultaneous enemies, 45–120 s runs

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| # | Principle | Rules | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| I | Deterministic Core | 1–4 | ✅ PASS | Core logic is pure TS; Phaser is an adapter |
| II | Explicit Game Loop | 5–8 | ✅ PASS w/ design | Phaser's loop used as rAF driver; fixed-timestep `update(dt)` called from Phaser scene `update()` — core owns the tick |
| III | Minimal Deps & Budgets | 9–12 | ⚠️ VIOLATION — JUSTIFIED | Phaser 3 (~300 kB gzipped) exceeds 150 kB budget; see Complexity Tracking |
| IV | Touch-First UX | 13–17 | ✅ PASS | Portrait default, 48 px targets, mute-safe, 1-tap retry |
| V | Offline-First | 18–22 | ✅ PASS | Vite PWA / manual SW; manifest with standalone + portrait |
| VI | Deterministic Testing | 23–27 | ✅ PASS | Vitest with seeded RNG + simulated clock; Playwright offline smoke |
| VII | Ad Isolation | 28–32 | ✅ PASS | Lazy-loaded ad adapter; never blocks core loop |
| VIII | Asset Pipeline | 33–37 | ✅ PASS | Vite hashes assets; CI script for compression + atlas; lazy-load by scene |
| IX | Minimal Ops | 38–42 | ✅ PASS | Static deploy; Capacitor bundles locally; analytics optional |

**Gate result**: PASS with 1 justified violation (Principle III — bundle size).

### Post-Design Re-evaluation (Phase 1 complete)

| # | Principle | Post-Design Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| I | Deterministic Core | ✅ CONFIRMED | `data-model.md` — all entities are plain TS interfaces; `GameState` owned by core; event bus is the only core→adapter channel |
| II | Explicit Game Loop | ✅ CONFIRMED | Fixed-timestep accumulator pattern validated in `research.md` §2; `RunPhase` FSM defined in `data-model.md` with all transitions |
| III | Minimal Deps & Budgets | ⚠️ VIOLATION STANDS | Research §1 confirms custom Phaser build targets ~180–210 kB gzipped; still exceeds 150 kB. Mitigation: code-split Phaser into its own chunk; lazy-load scenes |
| IV | Touch-First UX | ✅ CONFIRMED | `EngineCommands.setPlayerX()` for drag; 1-tap retry via `startNewRun()`; all events have visual payloads |
| V | Offline-First | ✅ CONFIRMED | `quickstart.md` — `vite-plugin-pwa` for web; Capacitor bundles locally; SW skipped on native (research §4: iOS WKWebView blocks SW) |
| VI | Deterministic Testing | ✅ CONFIRMED | `data-model.md` — `rngSeed` in `GameState`; injectable clock via `engine.step(dt)`; Vitest + seeded PRNG |
| VII | Ad Isolation | ✅ CONFIRMED | `contracts/game-events.md` — ad adapter subscribes to `run-phase-changed`; lazy-loaded; `AdConfig` separate from core |
| VIII | Asset Pipeline | ✅ CONFIRMED | `quickstart.md` — Vite hashes output; `assets-src/` for raw files; collision masks generated at load time (research §3) |
| IX | Minimal Ops | ✅ CONFIRMED | Static `dist/` deploy; analytics adapter fire-and-forget; no server infrastructure |

**Post-design gate result**: PASS — same 1 justified violation. No new violations introduced by Phase 1 design.

**Structure Decision**: Single-project layout with strict `src/core/` (pure)
vs `src/adapters/` (side-effectful) separation. Capacitor wraps the Vite
build output for native packaging. Constitution Principle I is enforced by
directory convention: `core/` must never import from `adapters/`, Phaser, or
any browser API.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Principle III rule 9: Phaser 3 is a major runtime dependency | Phaser provides battle-tested 2D rendering, sprite management, input handling, asset loading, and cross-browser WebGL/Canvas fallback — building these from scratch would take 10× longer and introduce more bugs | Custom Canvas renderer was considered but rejected: would need to reimplement sprite batching, atlas loading, input normalization, and device pixel ratio handling — all solved by Phaser |
| Principle III rule 10: Bundle size ~300 kB gzipped (exceeds 150 kB budget) | Phaser's tree-shakeable custom build can reduce to ~200 kB gzipped by excluding unused modules (3D, arcade physics, tilemaps, spine); further reduced via code-splitting so only boot scene loads initially | No lighter framework offers equivalent feature completeness for 2D games; raw Canvas API fits budget but lacks asset pipeline, input normalization, WebGL batching, and would require months of custom code |
